# magxTasksCoordinator Library

## Overview

The `magxTasksCoordinator` library provides a simple and flexible way to manage tasks and timers in Arduino projects. It allows you to create tasks with customizable timeout intervals, callback functions, and timer types. This library is particularly useful for implementing asynchronous behavior and managing time-sensitive tasks in your Arduino sketches.

## Features

- Create tasks with customizable timeout intervals.
- Support for one-shot and periodic timers.
- Ability to set callback functions for task execution.
- Support for repeat timeout callbacks.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

1. Download the `magxTasksCoordinator` library ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/magxTz/magxTasksCoordinator).
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...` and select the downloaded ZIP file.
3. The library will be installed and ready to use in your Arduino sketches.

## Usage

### Creating Tasks

To create a task, instantiate an object of the `magxTaskCoordinator` class with the desired timeout interval:

```cpp
magxTaskCoordinator task(timeoutMs);
```

You can optionally specify the number of repetitions and stoppage interval for periodic tasks.

### Setting Callbacks

Set callback functions to be executed when the task timeout occurs:

```cpp
task.setCallback(callbackFunction);
```

### Starting and Stopping Tasks

Start and stop tasks as needed:

```cpp
task.start();  // Start the task
task.stop();   // Stop the task
```

### Updating Tasks

Call the `update()` method periodically in your main loop to check for task timeouts:

```cpp
void loop() {
    // Update tasks
    task.update();
}
```

### Adding Tasks to Manager

Tasks can be managed by a `magxTasksManager` object. Add tasks to the manager for centralized control:

```cpp
magxTasksManager manager;
manager.addTimer(&task);
```

## Examples

## Achievable Functionalities

1. **Task Scheduling**: Ability to schedule tasks to run at specified intervals.
2. **Callback Execution**: Execution of callback functions when tasks timeout.
3. **Repeat Timeout Callbacks**: Support for executing a separate callback after a certain number of task repetitions.

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Schedule tasks to collect data from various sensors at regular intervals.
2. **Actuator Control**:
    - Use tasks to control actuators such as motors, LEDs, or relays based on specific conditions.
3. **Data Processing**:
    - Perform data processing tasks on collected sensor data before storage or transmission.
4. **System Monitoring**:
    - Monitor system health and status by scheduling tasks to check sensor readings, battery levels, or network connectivity.

## Use Case Examples

1. **Home Automation**:
    - Schedule tasks to read temperature and humidity sensors periodically.
    - Control smart home devices like lights, fans, or door locks based on sensor readings.
    - Process sensor data to adjust thermostat settings or trigger alerts for abnormal conditions.

2. **IoT Weather Station**:
    - Use tasks to collect data from weather sensors such as temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
    - Control actuators like wind speed sensors or rain gauges.
    - Process collected data to generate weather forecasts or trigger alerts for severe weather conditions.

3. **Industrial Monitoring**:
    - Schedule tasks to read data from industrial sensors like pressure, flow, or level sensors.
    - Control industrial equipment such as pumps, valves, or motors based on sensor readings.
    - Process sensor data to monitor production processes, detect anomalies, or optimize operations.

4. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Use tasks to collect data from environmental sensors like air quality, noise level, or radiation sensors.
    - Control actuators such as air purifiers, sound alarms, or radiation shields based on sensor readings.
    - Process collected data to monitor environmental conditions, identify pollution sources, or ensure safety compliance.

## Conclusion

The `magxTasksCoordinator` library provides a flexible framework for managing tasks and timers in Arduino projects. By leveraging its functionalities, developers can implement a wide range of applications spanning from home automation and IoT to industrial monitoring and environmental sensing. The provided example file demonstrates the basic usage of the library and serves as a starting point for building more complex projects.
